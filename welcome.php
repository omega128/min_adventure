<p>Welcome to <strong>Minimal Adventure!</strong></p>

<p>This... is you. Wave hello to yourself.</p>
<p><img src="images/you.png" alt="You"/></p>

<p>Now that you have started this game, you have a brand new purpose in life. Now you are... an <strong>ADVENTURER!</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/gear.png" alt="You + Adventuring Gear"/></p>

<p>As you begin your new career, you get a complimentary starting weapon (a Stick), a stylish uniform (Adventurer Pants), and a laminated ID card (50% off at Dave's Ice Cream Parlour!)</p>
<p>As an adventurer (...sorry, <strong>ADVENTURER!</strong>) your job is to gain gold and renown.</p>
<p>You do this by killing monsters, that give you gold, that you then use to buy better weapons and armor, so you can kill bigger monsters, that give you more gold, so you can buy better weapons and armor.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most vital part of being an adventurer is bragging about your skill as an adventurer. To do this, go to the <strong>Inn</strong> in the <strong>Town</strong> and scratch messages about your mighty deeds in the bathroom stall.</p>

<p>That's all you need to know for now. Now go forth, young adventurer! <strong>ADVENTURE AWAITS!</strong></p>
